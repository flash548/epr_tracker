## EPR Tracker App Front End

This is the front end (React js) for the EPR tracker app.

To build use `./build.sh` which will invoke `npm run-script build` and also 
copy over the `Dockerfile` and `server.js` to the 'build' directory.  

The `docker-compose` file looks in the 'build' directory for the Dockerfile.
